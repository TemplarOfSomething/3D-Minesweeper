The classic hit game minesweeper but its 3D

Current plan:
split files into their main focus, ex. logic for mine generation -> math, textures -> rendering, gui -> gui
placeholders are so folders go to github even if nothing else is in said folders

most important thing to do rn: get rendering working
then generation logic,
then gui,
GPIO should be fine but we will have to be sure we build it in before anything else
