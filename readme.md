# 3D Minesweeper

#### Requires Ursina, Ursina[extras], RPi.GPIO, math, random, time, fastAPI, Uvicorn, and Requests.


The classic minesweeper but in 3D.
Includes extra features, such as a layer mode and a mine"sweeping" mode. <br>

Layer mode provides the ability to look at a single layer of the minefield,
whether it be for easier access or to pick apart the minefield slowly and methodically.

Mine"sweeper" mode allows one to see how far away a mine is via LED indicator, but this requires the proper GPIO setup (which will be disclosed once it is figured out entirely)
